### TakeMeTour Internship Program 2018

Hi all applicants! Welcome to TakeMeTour Internship Program 2018. Being an intern at TakeMeTour is challenging so we have challenges for you! These challenges are designed to assess your learning skill, which is the fundamental and most important skill of a great software developer. So I do not expect you to have full or any knowledge about the topic beforehand but it's your job to try to learn and answer those challenges.

## Algorithm in Javascript
Code must be written in Javascript language. The code will be tested with Node8, so you can use all Javascript features that are available in Node8.

1. Write a function that shifts the elements of array to left or right by n elements in an infinite loop. the function receives 3 parameters, 1st is an array, 2nd is the direction ('left' or 'right'), 3rd is the number of elements which will be shifted. For example,
```
> shift(['john', 'jane', 'sarah', 'alex'], 'left', 2)
['sarah', 'alex', 'john', 'jane']

> shift([1, 2, 3, 4 ,5], 'right', 3)
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```

## Simple Web Application: A joke from Chuck Norris.

This part of the quest will be a challenging one. You are going to make a simple web application which allows users to get some jokes from **Chuck Norris** himself.

> Chuck Norris once ordered a Big Mac at Burger King, and got one.

### Features
- Users can get a joke from [Chuck Norris API](http://www.icndb.com/api/)
- Users have options to change the number of the resulting jokes, user's first name and last name
- UI Design: as you wish.

### Technical description
- Using data from [REST API](http://www.icndb.com/api/)
- Any tools & framework are allowed.
- Using tools & framework which are the same as our tech stack (React, Redux, styled-components, recompose etc.) will be a plus.
- Any extra feature will be a plus.
